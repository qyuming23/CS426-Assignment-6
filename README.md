# CS426-Assignment-6,7 and 8
CS 426 Assignment 7 added features:

For this assignment, we added several improvements to the physics and lighting.
For the physics, we improved the jump and double jump while also adding a dash. 
Since this game is centered around climbing, it's appropriate to have multiple movement based abiltiies to reach harder platforms.
We also added some lighting for each of the Ai's to make them stand out. The attack and patrol Ai's have flashlights and actively go after the player.
These ai's act as the guards of the tower. They can push players off platforms, shoot at the player to obstruct movement and send the player back to the beginning upon collision.
Towers are full of rats.
We have an animated model of old man rat at the very bottom of the tower. His job is to guard the teleporter but other than that, he's completely harmless.
There are also rats who act as guides. On some floors, animated rats point you towards the right direction.
The third animation is a place holder for now since there's no rigged model that fits the theme.

CS 426 Assignment 8 added features:

-Included a title screen with instructions on how to control the character. Since our game doesn't really make much use of on screen interactive buttons. The best changes we can make to the UI is a title screen that explains to the player everything he needs to know about how to control the character.
-Included a play button to transition to starting scene.
-Added 2 new levels. Since our game is a bit too easy at this point in time, added a few new levels with harder jumps.
-Added new background music to each level. This is to give each level a different feel.
-Added a new feature that teleports the player back to a checkpoint in a case where the player falls. Required because there's no way back up.

CS 426 Assignment 9 added features:
- We added a new dash because our test users said that it was too clunky.
- We added better box coliders for platforms.
- We added 3 shaders to the maps to make the look of the game more sophisticated. It makes the game look better, since it matches our theme better as well.
- We also added a credit and instruction screen for the requirements.
