# CS426-Assignment-6 and 7
CS 426 Assignment 7 added features:

For this assignment, we added several improvements to the physics and lighting.
For the physics, we improved the jump and double jump while also adding a dash. 
Since this game is centered around climbing, it's appropriate to have multiple movement based abiltiies to reach harder platforms.
We also added some lighting for each of the Ai's to make them stand out. The attack and patrol Ai's have flashlights and actively go after the player.
These ai's act as the guards of the tower. They can push players off platforms, shoot at the player to obstruct movement and send the player back to the beginning upon collision.
Towers are full of rats.
We have an animated model of old man rat at the very bottom of the tower. His job is to guard the teleporter but other than that, he's completely harmless.
There are also rats who act as guides. On some floors, animated rats point you towards the right direction.
The third animation is a place holder for now since there's no rigged model that fits the theme.
